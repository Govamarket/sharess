            <h1>What Is a Blockchain?<br>
                A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a
                database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known
                for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and
                decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the
                fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third
                party.

                One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A
                blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information.
                Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled
                block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly
                added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.
